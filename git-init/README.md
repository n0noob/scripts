# git-init.sh

### Motivation
Setting up git client after fresh installation is a monotonous and repetitive task.  

### Purpose
This small interactive script can be used to setup fresh installation of git with one's github account.

### How do I use it?
Make the script executable:
```
$ chmod 755 ./git-init.sh
```

In linux, soon after installing `git` package, start the script:
```
$ ./git-init.sh
```
