# timer.py

### Motivation
Manually calculating time spent in doing a task(like doing leetcode) was manual and boring. Needed something that could tell me precisely the `minutes` spent in performing a task.

### Purpose
This is a timer that I use for assessing the time spent in solving coding problems.

## How do I use it?
Make the script executable:
```
$ chmod 755 ./timer.py
```

Just open coding problem, fire the timer:
```
$ ./timer.py
```
