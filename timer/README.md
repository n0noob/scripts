# timer.py

### Motivation
Manually calculating time spent in doing a task(like doing leetcode) was manual and boring. Needed a simple linux friendly app that could tell me precisely the `minutes` spent in performing a task. Also, the app should be terminal friendly as I use tiling window manager.

### Purpose
This is a timer that I use for assessing the time spent in solving coding problems.

### How do I use it?
Make the script executable:
```
$ chmod 755 ./timer.py
```

Just open coding problem, fire the timer:
```
$ ./timer.py
```
